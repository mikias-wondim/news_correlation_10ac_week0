# Global News Data Analysis Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the Global News Data Analysis Repository! This repository is dedicated to analyzing the sentiment, topics, and reporting correlation among various global media agencies using the Global News dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the patterns and relationships within the dataset, leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling techniques.

## Business Objectives
1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Understand the sentiment distribution among news articles to gauge public opinion and sentiment trends over time.
2. **Topic Analysis:** Identify prevalent topics and themes across different news agencies to uncover emerging trends and areas of interest.
3. **Reporting Correlation:** Explore the correlation between news reporting by different agencies to assess the consistency and diversity of news coverage.
4. **Candidate Evaluation:** Evaluate candidates for the 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Generative AI Engineer (AIE), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) at 10 Academy.
5. **Training Program Assessment:** Provide applicants with real-world tasks to assess their discipline, resilience, proactivity, talent diversity, and other essential qualities required for the training program.
6. **Professional Development:** Offer project experience for candidates to showcase in their professional profiles, regardless of their selection for the training program.
